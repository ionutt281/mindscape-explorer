                                    <h2>Two types of fire</h2>
                                    <p>The two types of fire: fire of lust and fire of mindfulness.</p>
<p>“Here, friend Sariputta, a bhikkhu has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and consolidates what he has learned. Such teachings as are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and which affirm a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure — such teachings as these he has learned much of, remembered, mastered verbally, investigated with the mind, and penetrated well by view. And he teaches the Dhamma to the four assemblies with well-rounded and coherent statements and phrases for the eradication of the underlying tendencies." That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.” (32 Mahàgosinga Sutta: The Greater Discourse in Gosinga; Majjihima Nikaya - Middle Length Discourses Of The Buddha: https://archive.org/details/majjihimanikayamiddlelengthdiscoursesofthebuddhabhikkhunanamolibhikkubodhi_900_c/page/n315/mode/1up)</p>
<p>“Delight at heart, every disciple should not hesitate, wherever possible, to inculcate the Dharma that is real and subtle and to show the path of nirvana, believing in the testimony of what the knower of the path has been practicing.” (The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Vol. I: https://www.bdkamerica.org/product/the-canonical-book-of-the-buddhas-lengthy-discourses-vol-i/; page 77)</p>
<p>“And what, Punna, is dark action with dark result? Here someone generates an afflictive bodily formation, an afflictive verbal formation, an afflictive mental formation. Having generated an afflictive bodily formation, an afflictive verbal formation, an afflictive mental formation, he reappears in an afflictive world. When he has reappeared in an afflictive world, afflictive contacts touch him. Being touched by afflictive contacts, he feels afflictive feelings, extremely painful, as in the case of the beings in  hell. Thus a being’s reappearance is due to a being: one reappears through the actions one has performed. When one has reappeared, contacts touch one. Thus I say beings are the heirs of their actions. This is called dark action with dark result.” (57 Kukkuravatika Sutta: The Dog-duty Ascetic; Majjihima Nikaya)</p>
<p>“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, they see beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. They understand how beings pass on according to their actions thus: ‘These worthy beings who were ill-conducted in body, speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in hell;” (77 Mahasakuludayi Sutta: The Greater Discourse to Sakuludayin; Majjihima Nikaya)</p>
                                     <p>My understanding: wrong view is wrong understanding of purpose of life (not believing in karma, or wrong application of cleaning bad karma; right application is the eightfold path - by developing wholesome mind states to reach understanding and by this remove the defilments of sensual pleasures, of being and of ignorance, reaching final Nibbana), because of negligence in investigating thoroughly: “Investigate thoroughly, householder. It is good for such well-known people like you to investigate thoroughly.” (56 Upali Sutta: To Upali; Majjihima Nikaya). </p>
<p>How to investigate  thoroughly?  With the fire of mindfulness: 
“Here, Udayin, some person practices the way to the abandoning of attachment, to the relinquishing of attachment. When he is practicing the way, memories and intentions associated with attachment beset him now and then through lapses of mindfulness. His mindfulness may be slow in arising, but he quickly abandons them, removes them, does away with them, and annihilates them. Just as if a man were to let two or three drops of water fall onto an iron plate heated for a whole day, the falling of the water drops might be slow but they would quickly vaporise and vanish. So too, here some person practices the way...His mindfulness may be slow in arising, but he quickly abandons them, removes them, does away with them, and annihilates them. Such a person too I call fettered, not unfettered. Why is that? Because I have known the particular diversity of faculties in this person.”(66 Latukikopama Sutta: The Simile of the Quail; Majjihima Nikaya). I understand this statement as describing a stream-enterer. Memories and intentions associated with attachment  are unwholesome mind tendencies.  I see more clearly, as bad mind tendencies diminish.

<p>The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I, Sutra 8: Sandhāna:

The brāhmaṇa replied, “Very well, Gautama, explain why our forms of
practice are morally impure and deﬁled. I wish to know about it.”
The Buddha continued:
The ascetics engaged in self-mortifying forms of practice invariably
entertain an expectation in their mind, thinking, “My ascetic practice
should persuade people to make offerings with respect and admiration
[for my austerities].” This expectation is by nature a moral deﬁlement.
Having received an offering, satisﬁed and reinforced, these extreme
ascetics are ﬁrmly attached to their extreme forms of practice, neither
knowing how it is important to distance oneself from worldly matters,
nor knowing what the essential path of salvation is. This wrong orien-
tation is a moral deﬁlement.
If they see anyone near them or approaching them from a distance,
these extreme ascetics invariably assume their [arduous] practice of
meditation, but in the absence of other people they resume their undis-
ciplined behavior, idly sitting or lying about according to their incli-
nation. This is a moral deﬁlement.
Even when they hear a precise exposition of their doctrine by others,
they do not acknowledge that it is correct. This is a moral deﬁlement.
When a proper question about their doctrine is presented to them,
these extreme ascetics keep their mouths shut and do not answer or
explain it. This is a moral deﬁlement.
When they see people making offerings for the śramaṇas and brāh-
maṇas, these extreme ascetics accuse the donors to prevent their acts
of charity. This is a moral deﬁlement.
When they see the śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas partake of various
seed items that regrow as food (i.e., rice grains), these extreme ascetics
accuse them. This is a moral deﬁlement.
Even when they receive excess food that is not suitable for them,
these ascetics do not offer it to others. When they obtain food that is
suitable for them they greedily partake of it all by themselves, neither
seeing their own fault of greediness nor knowing that freedom from
attachment is essential to salvation. This is a moral deﬁlement.
These extreme ascetics praise their own goodness (regarding their
acts of self-mortiﬁcation), and discredit the practices of other schools.
This is a moral deﬁlement.
These extreme ascetics commit some of these wrongdoings: injuring
life, taking what is not given, engaging in sexual misconduct, engaging
in deceptive speech, verbal abuse, using false words, ﬂattery, greediness,
jealousy, and wrong views. This is a moral deﬁlement.
These extreme ascetics take delight in idleness and forgetfulness
of the practice of meditation, acquiring no insight, just like birds and
animals. This is a moral deﬁlement.
These extreme ascetics project a lofty air of self-conceit and arro-
gance. This is a moral deﬁlement.
These extreme ascetics not only have neither the virtue of faithful-
ness, nor of repeated practice, nor of genuine precepts, but they also
do not seriously listen to others’ admonitions. As they always associate
with wrong kinds of people, they continue to do wrong things without
ever despising their actions. This is a moral deﬁlement.
These extreme ascetics are prone to anger and resentment and they
contemplate treacherous schemes against others, trying to show off
their views and ﬁnding fault with others. They always entertain wrong
opinions and agree with one-sided views. This is a moral deﬁlement.
How then, Nyagrodha, can these manners of practice be said to be
morally free of blemish?
The brāhmaṇa replied, “These are morally deﬁled and cannot be said to
be pure and genuine [practices], sir.”
The Buddha continued, “Now, in reference to each of those morally deﬁled
forms of practice, I shall explain what the morally pure and genuine nature is.”
The brāhmaṇa replied, “Please explain them one by one, sir.”

These ascetics should cherish no expectation in their minds and aban-
don the thought, “My practice should bring me offerings, respect, and
admiration.” This nonanticipatory practice is free from moral deﬁlement.
After receiving offerings, these ascetics should not greedily attach
themselves to extreme forms of practice.They should become aware
of the importance of distancing themselves from worldly matters,
knowing what the essential path of salvation is. This right orientation
is free from moral deﬁlement.
These ascetics should maintain regularity in the practice of medi-
tation, whether or not other people are present or absent. This form of
discipline is free from moral deﬁlement.
These ascetics should be delighted when followers of other schools
have a correct understanding of their doctrines, and they should readily
acknowledge this. This discipline is free from moral deﬁlement.
These ascetics should be delighted when an appropriate question
is presented and they should openly answer and explain it. This disci-
pline is free from moral deﬁlement.
Seeing others offering charity to the śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas,
these ascetics should rejoice in the moral and religious advancement
expressed in such acts of charity, instead of discouraging the donors.
This discipline is free from moral deﬁlement.
Seeing the śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas who partake of various seed
items that regrow as food, these ascetics should not accuse them. This
discipline is free from moral deﬁlement.
These ascetics should neither be stingy with excess food that is not
suitable for them, nor should they be overwhelmed by greedy attach-
ment when they receive suitable food, thus reﬂecting upon their own
faults and knowing the essential path to salvation. This discipline is
free from moral deﬁlement.
These ascetics should not boast of their scrupulousness in practices
of self-mortiﬁcation, nor should they despise the practices of other
schools. This discipline is free from moral deﬁlement.
These ascetics should not commit any of the ten kinds of wrongdoing:
injuring life, taking what is not given, engaging in sexual misconduct,
deceptive speech, verbal abuse, false words, ﬂattery, greediness, jealousy,
and wrong views. This discipline is free from moral deﬁlement.
These ascetics should not be forgetful but diligently engage in the
practice of meditation and acquire many levels of insight, not regressing
to the state of ignorance, like animals. This discipline is free from
moral deﬁlement.
These ascetics should refrain from projecting a lofty air of self-con-
ceit and arrogance. This discipline is free from moral deﬁlement.
These ascetics should always enhance the virtues of faithfulness, con-
tinuous practice, and genuine precepts; they should listen seriously to
others’ admonitions, and by associating always with good people never
cease to do good things. This discipline is free from moral deﬁlement.
These ascetics should neither cherish anger and resentment, nor
contemplate treacherous schemes against others, nor show off their
own achievements while trying to ﬁnd fault in others, nor should they
entertain wrong opinions along with one-sided views or prejudices.
This discipline is free from moral deﬁlement.
Brāhmaṇa, are these forms of practice to be regarded as the way to
acquire morally blameless practice?
The brāhmaṇa replied, “Yes, these should be regarded as the way to
acquire morally blameless practice, sir.” He further asked the Buddha, “If
anyone upholds this kind of ascetic practice, is he regarded to have achieved
 the utmost essence of the practice, sir?”
The Buddha replied, “No, not yet. This is only the beginning, only the
outer bark portion of a tree.”

The brāhmaṇa spoke to the Buddha, “What is the primary of ascetic prac-
tice, sir?”
The Buddha replied, “O brāhmaṇa, listen attentively. I shall explain it to
you.”
The brāhmaṇa said, “Yes, World-honored One, I am ready, sir.”
The Buddha continued:
Each of these ascetics neither himself commits murder nor does he per-
suade another to do so; neither himself commits theft nor persuade
others to do so; neither himself commits sexual misconduct nor persuades
others to do so, neither himself speaks falsehoods nor persuades others
to do so. Instead he permeates friendly love inﬁnitely in one quarter of
the world, then likewise in the remaining three quarters. Thus he extends
his immeasurable mind of benevolence universally in all directions,
undivided and not bound to limitation. Without enmity, his mind of
benevolence permeates throughout the human world, and so do his
immeasurable minds of compassion, of sympathetic joy and of equa-
nimity [pervade] in a similar manner throughout the human world.
This ascetic becomes aware of things that have happened since
immemorial past eons, and entirely knows all those events during his
initial life, second life, and so forth, up to his innumerable positions
in the life cycle, throughout the periods from the beginning to the end
of many eons. He also knows through direct perception: “I was once
born in such-and-such class status, had such-and-such family name,
ate meals consisting of such-and-such food, lived to so-and-so many
years of age, and experienced such-and-such happiness and suffering.
I was reborn from that state to this one, and reborn from that to this,
and in this manner I recollect exhaustively all the things that happened
throughout immeasurable numbers of eons.”
With his pure and genuine heavenly vision he exhaustively perceives
and knows the kinds of sentient beings as passing away here and being
reborn there, as endowed with good complexions, handsome or ugly,
with resulting courses of life due to their good or bad deeds, wherever
they fall due to their deeds. Also he knows how some of those sentient
beings who committed wrong physical, verbal, and mental deeds, speak-
ing slanderous remarks against the wise and holy and believing in per-
verse, wrong views, fell into the three evil courses of life when their
bodies dissolved and their lives ended. He also knows how other sentient
beings who have accumulated good physical, verbal, and mental deeds,
who speak no evil against the wise and holy and hold the right view,
are born among heavenly gods when their bodies dissolved and their
lives ended. Thus, each practitioner, endowed with pure and genuine
heavenly vision, perceives [the destinies or fates of] sentient beings,
wherever they fall according to their deeds, and there is nothing he
cannot see. This is the primary essence of ascetic practice.
The Buddha said to the brāhmaṇa:
In this foremost primary type of ascetic practice, there is again a superior
one, on the basis of which I always teach my disciples (śrāvakas). Their
discipline of austerity is based on this superior type of ascetic practice.

At that time, the ﬁve hundred disciples of the brāhmaṇa listened eagerly
and attentively to what the Buddha was teaching. The Evil One Pāpīyān
thought to himself, “These ﬁve hundred disciples of the brāhmaṇa are now
eagerly and attentively listening to the Buddha’s teaching. I should go and
disrupt their minds.” Thereupon, the Evil One disrupted the minds of those
in the assembly.
At that moment, the Buddha said to Sandhāna:
While the brāhmaṇa’s ﬁve hundred disciples were eagerly and atten-
tively listening to my teaching, the Evil One Pāpīyān has now disrupted
their minds..."</p>

                                        
<p>My understanding: While trying to spark the fire of mindfulness, because of my obsessions, I have a quite wrong view about myself, so I am more prone to ill-will/ resentment, which is the source of agitation, sanran, ignorance, violence, suffering.</p>
<p>"He then told the boy, “When you wish to make a ﬁre you should do so in this manner. You cannot get ﬁre by splitting wood or pounding it.”
(The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I, Sutra 7: Pāyāsi’s Dialogue)</p>
