                        <h3 class="card-title">My daily practice</h3>
                        <p>- 1 hour in morning as instructed in Fukanzazengi: https://www.sfzc.org/files/daily_sutras_Fukanzazengi; in my undestanding it corresponds to second jhana and above.</p>
                  <p> - half an hour in total in evening to break sanran/agitation tendency of mind, by visualisation a couple of times as instructed in Wild Ivy Chapter 4: Zen Sickness, The Soft-Butter Method: https://inscribedonthebelievingmind.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hakuin_wildivy.pdf, then I concentrate on breaths on lower tanden/hara. In my understanding this corresponds to first jhana since it has a particular object to focus upon. </p>
                   <p> - in the rest of the time I practice mindfulness in all actions I do, by lowering expectancies and plans while concentrating on one thing at a time; it's hard since fears and obsessive thoughts keep popping up in my head, but with practice those speculative, temporary conclusions-thoughts and the other distractions can be cut off more easly.
                        Now devils will sense right away my somehow good and trimmed awareness and will try to obstruct from fireing further the mindfulness; you say is bogus, but go alone at night in forest and meditate and be aware of your quality of concentration
                        to see when near noises from animals and nature trigger right when I managed to unify my mind to some degree from worries and passions; keep pushing the awareness in aversive situations by not acting because of revenge reasons. Better to seek and follow an accomplished and enlightened buddhist teacher in a temple if you have possibility. They will know the right application against ego only and will teach you how
                        level of compassion rises as ego (will towards impermanence) is diminished. While letting go of ego by following right admonitions and such, beware always to keep your dignity (do not be persuaded by bad advices, mischevious jokes and mockery, or threats which leads to unwholesome mind states based on fears and passions, which would make me prone to bad karma habits).</p>
                                 
                   <p>“ 8. Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts in full awareness
when going forward and returning; who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; who acts in full
awareness when flexing and extending his limbs; who acts in
full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer
robe and bowl; who acts in full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts in full awareness
when defecating and urinating; who acts in full awareness when
walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking,
and keeping silent."
(10 Satipatthana Sutta: The Foundations of Mindfulness; Majjihima Nikaya - Middle Length Discourses Of The Buddha: https://archive.org/details/majjihimanikayamiddlelengthdiscoursesofthebuddhabhikkhunanamolibhikkubodhi_900_c/page/n315/mode/1up)
<br></p>
 <p>- stream-entry fruit: The three fetters destroyed by the stream-enterer are personality view, doubt in Buddha and adherence to external rules and observances believing that solely bodily actions with no benevolent intent and only faith can purify oneself (superstitions). These feathers I let go by daily practice. </p>
 <p>"18. Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue, and this noble
restraint of the faculties, and possessing this noble mindfulness
and full awareness, he resorts to a secluded resting place: the
forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a
charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.
19. On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits
down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and
establishing mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world, he abides with a mind free from covetousness;
he purifies his mind from covetousness. Abandoning ill will and
hatred, he abides with a mind free from ill will, compassionate
for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill
will and hatred. Abandoning sloth and torpor, he abides free
from sloth and torpor, percipient of light, mindful and fully
aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor. Abandoning
restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated with a mind
inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and
remorse. Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond
doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his
mind from doubt.
20. “Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from
sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters
upon and abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by
applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born
of seclusion.
22. Bhikkhus, I do not say that final knowledge is achieved
all at once. On the contrary, final knowledge is achieved by
gradual training, by gradual practice, by gradual progress."
(51 Kandaraka Sutta: To Kandaraka; Majjihima Nikaya))</p>

<p>"What is a singular item that is difﬁcult to realize? It is the state of continuous concentration without lapse."
(The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I; Sutra 10: Ten Progressively Classiﬁed Doctrines; https://www.bdkamerica.org/product/the-canonical-book-of-the-buddhas-lengthy-discourses-vol-i/)</p>

<p> - final arahant-fruit:
 "12. I do not say of those bhikkhus who are arahants with
taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to
be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed
the fetters of being, and are completely liberated through final
knowledge, that they still have work to do with diligence. Why
is that? They have done their work with diligence; they are no
more capable of being negligent."

                <p><span class="sentence">How much of our mental activity occurs outside conscious awareness?</span> <span class="sentence">This question has puzzled psychologists for decades.</span> <span class="sentence">Research shows that the unconscious mind processes information at a speed that dwarfs conscious thought.</span></p>
                
                <p><span class="sentence">These hidden processes shape our thoughts, decisions, and behaviors in ways we're only beginning to understand.</span> <span class="sentence">Cognitive biases, those systematic errors in thinking, often originate from these unconscious processes.</span> <span class="sentence">For instance, confirmation bias leads us to favor information that confirms our existing beliefs.</span></p>
                
                <p><span class="sentence">Similarly, the availability heuristic makes us overestimate the importance of information that comes readily to mind.</span> <span class="sentence">Understanding these mechanisms can help us make better decisions and understand human behavior more deeply.</span></p>
                
                <p><span class="sentence">The study of the cognitive unconscious reveals that we are not as rational as we like to believe.</span> <span class="sentence">Much of our mental activity operates below the surface, influencing us in ways we rarely acknowledge.</span> <span class="sentence">By bringing these processes to light, we gain greater self-awareness and cognitive control.</span></p>
                
                <p><span class="sentence">Modern neuroscience has provided fascinating insights into this hidden world of cognition.</span> <span class="sentence">fMRI studies show that decisions we believe are conscious actually begin in unconscious regions of the brain milliseconds before we're aware of them.</span> <span class="sentence">This challenges our fundamental notions of free will and intentional action.</span></p>
                
                <p><span class="sentence">The implications for everyday life are profound.</span> <span class="sentence">When we understand that many of our choices are influenced by factors outside our awareness, we can develop strategies to mitigate unwanted biases.</span> <span class="sentence">This is particularly important in areas like hiring, medical diagnosis, and judicial decisions where objectivity is paramount.</span></p>
                
                <p><span class="sentence">Training programs that increase awareness of cognitive biases have shown promising results.</span> <span class="sentence">Medical professionals trained in recognizing cognitive biases make fewer diagnostic errors.</span> <span class="sentence">Judges who understand how anchoring bias affects sentencing deliver more consistent rulings.</span></p>
                
                <p><span class="sentence">The journey into the cognitive unconscious is not just academic - it's a practical pathway to better decision-making and greater self-understanding.</span> <span class="sentence">By exploring this hidden landscape of the mind, we unlock new potentials for personal growth and societal improvement.</span></p>
